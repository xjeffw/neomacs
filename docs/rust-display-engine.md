# Strategy 4: Full Rust Display Engine

Replace Emacs's C display engine (`xdisp.c`, `dispnew.c`, ~40k LOC) with a Rust layout engine that reads buffer data directly and produces GPU-ready glyph batches.

## Current Architecture

```
Emacs redisplay (C, xdisp.c ~30k LOC)
  → glyph matrices (current_matrix)
    → neomacsterm.c extracts glyphs (FFI boundary)
      → FrameGlyphBuffer sent to Rust via crossbeam
        → wgpu renders
```

### Pain Points

- **Double work**: Emacs builds a full CPU-side glyph matrix, then we serialize it again into `FrameGlyphBuffer`.
- **FFI friction**: Every new feature (cursors, borders, images, animations) requires C-side extraction code + Rust-side handling.
- **CPU-centric design**: Emacs redisplay was designed for `XDrawString` / terminal cells, not GPU batched rendering.
- **No GPU awareness**: Layout doesn't know about GPU capabilities (instancing, atlas caching, compute shaders).

## Proposed Architecture

**IMPORTANT**: Layout must run on the **Emacs thread**, not the render thread. See [Critical Design Constraint: Synchronization](#critical-design-constraint-synchronization) for why.

```
Emacs buffer/overlay/face data
  → Rust layout engine (called on Emacs thread during redisplay)
    → LayoutOutput (backend-agnostic glyph positions)
      → sent to render thread via crossbeam
        → wgpu renders (GPU) or TuiRenderer (terminal)
```

Layout results (window-end, cursor position, visibility) are also fed back to Emacs so that Lisp query functions (`pos-visible-in-window-p`, `window-end`, etc.) continue to work.

## Critical Design Constraint: Synchronization

Many Emacs Lisp functions require **synchronous access** to layout results. These aren't obscure — they're called on every keystroke by popular packages:

| Function | Who calls it | What it does |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| `pos-visible-in-window-p` | posframe, company, corfu, vertico | Runs the display iterator from scratch |
| `window-end` | helm, ivy, magit, every scroll package | Runs `start_display()` + `move_it_vertically()` |
| `vertical-motion` | `forward-line`, `recenter`, all movement | Runs the full iterator with wrapping |
| `posn-at-point` / `posn-at-x-y` | Mouse tracking, popup positioning, tooltips | Queries glyph matrix |
| `move-to-column` | Indentation, `kill-rectangle`, column movement | Scans line with tab/display prop handling |
| `compute-motion` | Low-level motion, `goto-line` | Full layout computation |

Additionally, **fontification runs DURING layout**. `jit-lock` calls `fontification-functions` as the iterator advances through unfontified text. This is Lisp code that must execute on the Emacs thread. Layout cannot be purely on the render thread — it calls back into Lisp.

**Consequence**: The Rust layout engine must run on the Emacs thread (called during `redisplay_internal()`). Layout results are then sent to the render thread for rendering. Parallel layout (layout on render thread while Emacs executes Lisp) is a future optimization (Phase 8+), not a starting point.

### Synchronous Lisp Function Categories

**Category A — Read cached state (safe to defer):**
`window-start`, `window-hscroll`, `window-vscroll`, `window-body-width`, `window-body-height`, `window-text-width`, `window-text-height`, `coordinates-in-window-p`

**Category B — Read current matrix (needs up-to-date layout):**
`window-line-height`, `window-lines-pixel-dimensions`, `posn-at-x-y`

**Category C — Trigger layout computation (CRITICAL — blocks Lisp):**
`window-end(update=t)`, `pos-visible-in-window-p`, `vertical-motion`, `move-to-column`, `compute-motion`, `move-to-window-line`, `recenter`

**Category D — Modify state and trigger redisplay:**
`set-window-start`, `set-window-hscroll`, `set-window-vscroll`, `scroll-up`/`scroll-down`, `scroll-left`/`scroll-right`

**Category E — Hooks that expect synchronous state:**
`pre-redisplay-function` (runs INSIDE `redisplay_internal()`), `fontification-functions` (runs DURING iterator scanning), `window-scroll-functions`, `post-command-hook`

## What We Keep vs Replace

### Keep (Emacs C/Lisp)

- Buffer management (gap buffer, undo, markers)
- Text properties and overlays (Lisp-level API)
- Window tree management (splits, sizing)
- Face definitions and merging (Lisp-level `defface`)
- Fontset/font selection logic
- Mode-line format evaluation (`format-mode-line`)

### Replace (Rust)

- The display iterator (`struct it` — 550+ fields state machine in `xdisp.c`)
- Line layout (`display_line()` — wrapping, truncation, alignment)
- Glyph production (`produce_glyphs()` — metrics, positioning)
- Matrix management (`dispnew.c` — desired/current diff)
- The extraction layer (`neomacsterm.c` glyph walking)

## Reading Lisp Data from Rust

Rust needs access to:

| Data | Where it lives | Access pattern |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| Buffer text | Gap buffer (`BUF_BYTE_ADDRESS`) | Contiguous reads around gap |
| Text properties | Interval tree on buffer | Walk intervals for face/display/invisible |
| Overlays | Sorted linked lists on buffer | Scan overlays at each position |
| Faces | `face_cache->faces_by_id[]` on frame | Lookup by ID, merge multiple |
| Window geometry | `struct window` fields | Read pixel_left/top/width/height |
| Window-start | Marker on window | Read marker position |
| Font metrics | `struct font` on face | Ascent, descent, average width |

### Approach A: Snapshot (recommended, start here)

At `update_end`, C serializes a **layout snapshot** to Rust:

```rust
struct LayoutSnapshot {
    windows: Vec<WindowSnapshot>,
}

struct WindowSnapshot {
    id: i64,
    bounds: Rect,
    buffer: BufferSnapshot,
    window_start: usize,
    hscroll: i32,
    selected: bool,
}

struct BufferSnapshot {
    text: Vec<u8>,                      // Full buffer text (no gap)
    intervals: Vec<PropertyInterval>,   // Text property spans
    overlays: Vec<OverlaySpan>,         // Active overlays
}

struct PropertyInterval {
    start: usize,
    end: usize,
    face_id: Option<u32>,
    display: Option<DisplaySpec>,
    invisible: bool,
}
```

**Pros**: Clean Rust ownership, no unsafe, thread-safe.
**Cons**: Copies all buffer text every frame (~0.1ms for 1MB buffer).

### Approach B: Shared-memory / FFI read (optimize later)

Rust reads Emacs data structures directly via `unsafe` FFI pointers:

```rust
unsafe fn read_buffer_char(buf: *const EmacsBuffer, pos: usize) -> char {
    // Handle gap buffer directly
}

unsafe fn get_face(frame: *const EmacsFrame, face_id: u32) -> &Face {
    // Read from face_cache->faces_by_id[face_id]
}
```

**Pros**: Zero-copy, instant access.
**Cons**: Extremely unsafe, must synchronize with Emacs thread, Emacs struct layout changes break everything.

**Recommendation**: Start with Approach A, optimize to B later for large buffers. The snapshot cost is negligible for typical buffer sizes (<100KB).

## Phased Implementation

### Phase -1: Direct Glyph Hook (Low-Risk Stepping Stone)

Before the full rewrite, eliminate the matrix intermediary without changing the layout engine. Keep `xdisp.c` but hook into `produce_glyphs` / `append_glyph` so it calls into Rust directly as glyphs are generated, instead of extracting from `current_matrix` after the fact.

```
CURRENT:   xdisp.c → glyph matrix → neomacsterm.c extracts → FFI → Rust renders
PHASE -1:  xdisp.c → calls Rust directly during produce_glyphs → Rust renders
```

**Benefits**:
- Keeps 100% compatibility (same layout algorithm, all Lisp functions work)
- Eliminates the matrix → extraction → FFI overhead
- Still gets Rust rendering, cosmic-text, GPU batching
- Doesn't break any packages
- Much lower risk (~2000 LOC changes)
- Proves the architecture before committing to the full rewrite

**Does not enable**: Pixel-level scrolling, parallel layout, TUI backend (those require the full rewrite).

**Scope**: ~2000 LOC. **Difficulty**: Medium. **Risk**: Low.

### Phase 0: Layout Snapshot Infrastructure

Add C function `neomacs_build_layout_snapshot()` that serializes buffer text + property intervals + overlays into a flat buffer. Send snapshot to Rust alongside (or replacing) `FrameGlyphBuffer`. Rust ignores snapshot initially, still uses old glyph path.

Note: Display property serialization is complex — 14 display spec types with composability (lists/vectors of specs), overlay strings with their own properties, 5-level nesting.

**Scope**: ~1000 C, ~500 Rust. **Difficulty**: Medium-Hard.

### Phase 1: Monospace ASCII Layout Engine

Build `RustLayoutEngine` that handles the simplest case:

- Fixed-width font, single face, no overlays, no display properties
- Line breaking at window width (or `truncate-lines`)
- Cursor positioning
- Window-start / point tracking
- Tab stops (`tab-width`, `tab-stop-list`)
- Control characters (`^X` = 2 columns, `\NNN` = 4 columns)
- Wide characters (CJK = 2 columns)
- Continuation glyphs (line wrapping indicators)

This alone covers ~70% of what you see in a typical coding buffer.

Must also implement **layout result feedback** to Emacs: `window-end`, cursor (x,y), and visibility info so that `pos-visible-in-window-p`, `vertical-motion`, `move-to-column` etc. return correct results.

**Scope**: ~2500 Rust. **Difficulty**: Medium.

### Phase 1.5: TUI Renderer

See [TUI Rendering Backend](#tui-rendering-backend) section.

**Scope**: ~1200 Rust. **Difficulty**: Medium.

### Phase 2: Face Resolution

- Read face intervals from snapshot
- Apply face attributes (fg, bg, bold, italic, underline)
- Handle face merging (text property face + all overlay faces, priority-ordered)
- Face realization: compute pixel values, select font from fontset
- Use existing cosmic-text for font selection per face
- Unlimited overlays can contribute faces at one position (`face_at_buffer_position` merges all)

**Scope**: ~1500 Rust. **Difficulty**: Medium-Hard.

### Phase 3: Display Properties

This is the most complex phase. Emacs has 14 display spec types with composability:

**Display spec types:**
1. `(when FORM . VALUE)` — conditional display
2. `(height HEIGHT)` — font height adjustment
3. `(space-width WIDTH)` — width scaling
4. `(min-width (WIDTH))` — minimum width padding
5. `(slice X Y WIDTH HEIGHT)` — image cropping
6. `(raise FACTOR)` — vertical offset (fraction of line height)
7. `(left-fringe BITMAP [FACE])` — left fringe bitmap
8. `(right-fringe BITMAP [FACE])` — right fringe bitmap
9. `((margin LOCATION) SPEC)` — margin display (left/right/nil)
10. `(space ...)` — space/stretch specs (`:width`, `:align-to`, `:relative-width`, `:height`)
11. `(image ...)` — image display
12. `(video ...)` — video display (neomacs extension)
13. `(webkit ...)` — WebKit display (neomacs extension)
14. `string` — replacement string with its own properties

**Composability**: Specs can be nested in lists/vectors. The display iterator uses a 5-level push/pop stack (`IT_STACK_SIZE = 5`) to handle nested contexts: display strings inside overlay strings inside display properties.

**Overlay strings** (`before-string` / `after-string`):
- Priority-based sorting (complex ordering: after-strings before before-strings, decreasing/increasing priority)
- Chunked processing (16 at a time via `OVERLAY_STRING_CHUNK_SIZE`)
- Overlay strings can have their own text properties (including face and display properties) — creating recursive layout
- Window-specific overlay filtering

**Additional features in this phase:**
- `invisible` property — skip text ranges (with ellipsis option)
- `line-prefix` / `wrap-prefix` — continuation line indentation
- Fringe bitmaps — 25 standard types + custom (arrows, brackets, indicators)
- Margin areas — `display-line-numbers-mode`, margin display specs
- `format-mode-line` result integration (text with properties from Lisp)

**Scope**: ~5000 Rust. **Difficulty**: Very hard.

### Phase 4: Mode-line, Header-line & Tab-line

- Evaluate mode-line format (stays in Lisp via `format-mode-line`)
- C sends pre-formatted mode-line/header-line/tab-line strings + faces to Rust
- Rust lays out each special row
- Handle `format-mode-line` which evaluates arbitrary Lisp (conditionals, `%e`, `%@`, etc.)

**Scope**: ~1000 Rust. **Difficulty**: Medium.

### Phase 5: Variable-width & Compositions

- Variable-width font support (cosmic-text already handles this)
- Emoji/composition support (already working in current system)
- Ligatures (cosmic-text + rustybuzz)
- Font fallback chains, metric computation

**Scope**: ~1200 Rust. **Difficulty**: Medium.

### Phase 6: Bidi

- Integrate `unicode-bidi` crate for reordering
- Handle mixed LTR/RTL paragraphs
- Integration with ALL of the above: line breaking, cursor movement, overlay strings, display properties
- Every other phase's complexity increases with bidi
- This is the hardest single feature

**Scope**: ~3000 Rust. **Difficulty**: Very hard.

### Phase 7: Images & Media

- Inline images (already rendered by wgpu, just need layout positioning)
- Video/WebKit (same — just need position from layout)

**Scope**: ~400 Rust. **Difficulty**: Easy.

### Phase 8+: Parallel Layout (Future)

Once Phases 0-7 are complete and stable:
- Move layout to render thread for parallel execution
- Implement synchronous RPC for Category C Lisp functions
- Cache layout results for fast Category B queries
- Enable pixel-level smooth scrolling with async window-start feedback

This phase depends on the entire layout engine being correct and stable first.

### Summary

| Phase | LOC (Rust) | Difficulty | Enables |
|-------|-----------|------------|---------|
| -1: Direct glyph hook | ~2000 | Medium | Proves architecture, low risk |
| 0: Snapshot infra | ~1000 C, ~500 Rust | Medium-Hard | Foundation |
| 1: Monospace ASCII | ~2500 Rust | Medium | Basic editing |
| 1.5: TUI renderer | ~1200 Rust | Medium | Terminal Emacs |
| 2: Faces | ~1500 Rust | Medium-Hard | Syntax highlighting |
| 3: Display props | ~5000 Rust | Very hard | Packages (company, which-key, org) |
| 4: Mode-line | ~1000 Rust | Medium | Status display |
| 5: Variable-width | ~1200 Rust | Medium | Proportional fonts, ligatures |
| 6: Bidi | ~3000 Rust | Very hard | International text |
| 7: Images/media | ~400 Rust | Easy | Already working |

**Total: ~17-18k LOC Rust replacing ~40k LOC C.** The reduction comes from:

- No terminal backend code needed
- No X11/GTK drawing code needed
- No incremental matrix diffing (GPU redraws everything)
- Modern Rust text crates handle Unicode/shaping complexity

### Previously Missing Components (Now Included)

These were absent from the original design and are now incorporated into the phases above:

| Component | Phase | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Fringe bitmaps (25 standard + custom) | 3 | Arrows, brackets, debugging indicators |
| Margin areas / `display-line-numbers-mode` | 3 | Very commonly used |
| `vertical-motion` / `move-to-column` feedback | 1 | Cursor movement depends on layout |
| `window-end` feedback to Emacs | 1 | Many packages query this |
| jit-lock / fontification integration | 1 | Rust layout must trigger Lisp fontification |
| Minibuffer resize (`resize-mini-windows`) | 3 | Dynamic height based on content |
| Tab-line | 4 | Window tab bar |
| Iterative window-start computation (2-5 passes) | 1 | Scroll policies: `scroll-margin`, `scroll-step`, etc. |
| Child frames | 3 | posframe, etc. — independent layout per frame |

## What This Unlocks

**Immediate benefits (Phases 0-7):**

1. **Unified Rust codebase** — layout and rendering in same language. No more C extraction layer, no FFI serialization per frame.
2. **Memory safety** — no more buffer overflows in display code. Emacs has had CVEs in xdisp.c.
3. **Modern text stack** — cosmic-text + rustybuzz = proper ligatures, OpenType features, font fallback.
4. **Simpler architecture** — no glyph matrix intermediary. Layout produces render-ready data directly.
5. **TUI backend for free** — same layout engine outputs to terminal.
6. **Testability** — Rust unit tests for layout logic. Currently impossible to test xdisp.c in isolation.
7. **Incremental layout** — Rust can diff against previous layout and only re-layout changed regions.
8. **Ligatures everywhere** — cosmic-text + rustybuzz handle OpenType ligatures natively.

**Future benefits (Phase 8+):**

9. **Pixel-level smooth scrolling** — sub-line viewport with async position feedback to Emacs.
10. **Sub-frame cursor movement** — cursor position computed in render thread, animated instantly.
11. **Parallel layout** — layout on render thread while Emacs executes Lisp.
12. **Custom rendering effects** — animated text insertion, per-character fade-in, elastic overscroll.

## Difficulty Analysis

### What's Actually Easy

1. **Monospace ASCII without properties** — count chars, break at width, position on grid. This is what Alacritty does.
2. **Basic face application** — once positioned, applying fg/bg/bold/italic is straightforward table lookup.
3. **Cursor rendering** — already done in current Rust renderer.
4. **Images/video/webkit** — already rendered by wgpu. Layout just reserves space.
5. **TUI output** — quantize pixel coordinates to cell grid, diff, emit ANSI. Well-understood.
6. **Glyph rasterization** — cosmic-text handles this well.

### What's Hard (Ranked)

**1. Display properties + overlay strings (Phase 3)**

The single hardest phase. 14 display spec types with composability, 5-level nesting via push/pop stack, recursive overlay string properties. This is where most Emacs redisplay bugs live. `handle_single_display_spec` alone is 634 lines of C with deeply nested conditionals. The overlay string machinery adds another ~400 lines. All interactions between these systems must be faithfully replicated.

**2. Synchronization with Emacs Lisp**

Layout results must flow back to Emacs for `pos-visible-in-window-p`, `window-end`, `vertical-motion`, etc. These are called synchronously from Lisp and must return correct results immediately. The Rust layout engine must maintain queryable state that matches what these functions expect.

**3. Iterative window-start computation**

Emacs does 2-5 layout passes per frame to find the correct `window-start`:
- Try displaying from current start → check if point is visible
- If not, adjust `window-start` → retry
- Handle `scroll-margin`, `scroll-conservatively`, `scroll-step`
- Three optimization tiers: `try_window_reusing_current_matrix` → `try_window_id` → `try_window`

This iterative process is deeply intertwined with layout and must work correctly.

**4. jit-lock / fontification integration**

Fontification runs DURING layout iteration, calling into Lisp. The Rust layout engine must pause layout, call into C/Lisp for fontification via FFI callback, then resume with the newly-applied faces. This is architecturally messy.

**5. Face realization + merging**

Not just reading a face_id. Involves: merge text property face + ALL overlay faces (unlimited, priority-ordered), then realize (compute pixel values, select font from fontset). `face_at_buffer_position` is ~130 lines, but font selection from the fontset system adds significant complexity.

**6. Bidi (Phase 6)**

Not just "use unicode-bidi crate." The crate handles the algorithm, but integrating bidi with line breaking, cursor movement, overlay strings, and display properties creates multiplicative complexity. Every other phase gets harder with bidi.

### What's Medium

- **Margin areas / line numbers** — `display-line-numbers-mode` is margin-based, needs its own layout per row.
- **Fringe bitmaps** — 25 standard types + custom. Need bitmap rendering pipeline.
- **Mode-line** — `format-mode-line` evaluates arbitrary Lisp. Serialization of results is the hard part.
- **Minibuffer resize** — full buffer scan for height, dynamic window resizing during redisplay.

## Pros vs Cons

### Pros

1. **Unified Rust codebase** — layout and rendering in same language. No C extraction layer, no FFI serialization per frame.
2. **Memory safety** — no buffer overflows in display code.
3. **Modern text stack** — cosmic-text, rustybuzz for ligatures, proper Unicode support.
4. **Simpler architecture** — no glyph matrix intermediary. Layout produces render-ready data.
5. **TUI backend** — same layout engine for terminal rendering. Currently impossible.
6. **Testability** — Rust unit tests for layout. Currently impossible to test xdisp.c in isolation.
7. **Future GPU optimizations** — layout aware of GPU capabilities.
8. **Incremental layout** — diff against previous layout, only re-layout changed regions.

### Cons

1. **Layout must run on Emacs thread** — the "parallel layout" benefit is deferred to Phase 8+. Many Lisp functions need synchronous layout access. This limits the performance gain vs current architecture.
2. **Scope is ~2x original estimate** — ~17k LOC Rust, not ~8-10k. Display properties and missing components account for the increase.
3. **Compatibility risk** — every Emacs package is a test case. Subtle layout differences = visual bugs. Packages like posframe, company, corfu, org-mode, magit depend on exact redisplay behavior.
4. **Display property complexity** — 14 types with composability, 5-level nesting, recursive overlay string properties. The long tail of edge cases will take months.
5. **jit-lock callback** — Rust calling back into Lisp during layout is architecturally messy. FFI boundary goes both directions.
6. **Regression risk** — xdisp.c is battle-tested over 40 years. A rewrite will have bugs the original doesn't.
7. **Two-way data flow** — layout results must flow back to Emacs for Lisp functions. Not just Emacs→Rust, also Rust→Emacs.
8. **Parallel development burden** — must maintain both old and new display engines during multi-phase transition.
9. **Iterative window-start** — the 2-5 pass window-start computation is deeply tied to layout and scroll policies. Getting this wrong breaks scrolling.

## Compatibility Risk

The biggest risk is Emacs packages that depend on redisplay behavior:

- **posframe** — creates child frames at specific pixel positions via `posn-at-point`
- **company-mode / corfu** — popup overlays positioned relative to point via `pos-visible-in-window-p`
- **which-key** — positioned popups
- **org-mode** — heavy use of display properties, invisible text, overlays, `line-prefix`
- **magit** — thousands of overlays for diff coloring, section folding via `invisible`
- **helm / ivy / vertico** — rapid overlay creation/deletion, face changes on every keystroke
- **lsp-mode / eglot** — diagnostic overlays with `after-string`, inline hints

**Functions that MUST return correct results:**
- `pos-visible-in-window-p` — "is buffer position visible?"
- `posn-at-point` / `posn-at-x-y` — pixel-to-position conversion
- `window-end` — last visible buffer position
- `vertical-motion` — move by visual lines
- `move-to-column` — move to specific column
- `compute-motion` — full motion computation
- `current-column` — get current column

**Mitigation**: Phase -1 (direct glyph hook) proves the rendering architecture works without any compatibility risk. Full layout rewrite proceeds incrementally with continuous testing against real packages.

## Alternative Considered: GPU Compute Layout (Strategy 5)

Rejected. GPU compute shaders for text layout would push line breaking, glyph positioning, and wrapping to the GPU. However:

- **Line breaking is inherently sequential** — can't know where line N+1 starts until line N finishes. GPU parallelism doesn't help.
- **Bidi is impossible on GPU** — the Unicode Bidi Algorithm has deeply sequential state (embedding levels, bracket matching). Not expressible in WGSL.
- **Text shaping must stay on CPU** — HarfBuzz/rustybuzz needs CPU access to font tables for ligatures, kerning, mark attachment.
- **Branching kills GPU perf** — overlays, display properties, invisible text, variable-width fonts all require per-glyph branching. GPUs hate divergent branches.
- **No ecosystem** — no existing references for GPU text layout in editors.
- **The bottleneck doesn't exist** — a typical frame has ~3000-8000 visible glyphs. CPU layout for that is <1ms.

Strategy 4 (CPU Rust layout + GPU render) gives 95% of the performance benefit with 10% of the complexity. Every modern editor (VS Code, Zed, Lapce, Alacritty) uses this architecture.

## TUI Rendering Backend

A major benefit of owning layout in Rust: one layout engine, multiple renderers. The same `RustLayoutEngine` that produces glyph batches for wgpu can also output to a terminal grid, giving us a true TUI Emacs.

### Architecture

```
                              ┌─→ WgpuRenderer (GPU)
LayoutSnapshot → RustLayout ──┤
                              └─→ TuiRenderer (terminal)
```

The layout engine produces a backend-agnostic intermediate representation:

```rust
struct LayoutOutput {
    rows: Vec<LayoutRow>,
}

struct LayoutRow {
    glyphs: Vec<LayoutGlyph>,
    y: f32,
    height: f32,
}

struct LayoutGlyph {
    char: char,
    x: f32,
    width: f32,
    face_id: u32,
    is_cursor: bool,
    // ... other attributes
}
```

The **WgpuRenderer** consumes this as pixel-positioned glyph batches (current path). The **TuiRenderer** maps this to a cell grid:

```rust
struct TuiRenderer {
    terminal: crossterm::Terminal,   // or termwiz / ratatui backend
    grid: Vec<Vec<Cell>>,           // rows x cols cell grid
    prev_grid: Vec<Vec<Cell>>,      // previous frame for diffing
}

struct Cell {
    char: char,
    fg: Color,
    bg: Color,
    attrs: CellAttrs,  // bold, italic, underline, strikethrough
}
```

### How TUI Rendering Works

1. **Layout**: `RustLayoutEngine` produces `LayoutOutput` with pixel coordinates
2. **Quantize**: TuiRenderer maps pixel positions to cell grid (divide by cell width/height)
3. **Diff**: Compare current grid against previous grid
4. **Emit**: Output only changed cells via ANSI escape sequences

### Terminal Features

| Feature | GPU (wgpu) | TUI (terminal) |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Text rendering | Glyph atlas + shader | ANSI escape sequences |
| Colors | 32-bit RGBA linear | 256-color / 24-bit truecolor |
| Bold/italic | Font variant selection | SGR attributes |
| Underline | Custom pixel drawing | SGR underline (wavy if supported) |
| Images | GPU texture | Sixel / Kitty graphics protocol |
| Cursor | Animated, blinking | Terminal cursor escape |
| Smooth scroll | Pixel-level | Line-level (or pixel with Kitty) |
| Ligatures | Full OpenType | Not possible (cell grid) |
| Variable-width | Full support | Monospace only |
| Box drawing | SDF rounded rects | Unicode box characters |
| Video/WebKit | Inline rendering | Not supported |
| Mouse | Full pixel tracking | Cell-level tracking |
| DPI scaling | Automatic | Terminal handles it |
| Performance | 120fps GPU | 60fps terminal refresh |

### Crate Choices

- **crossterm** — Cross-platform terminal manipulation (input, output, raw mode). Mature, widely used.
- **ratatui** — TUI framework built on crossterm. Provides widget abstractions, but we may only need the backend layer since we have our own layout.
- **termwiz** — Alternative from wezterm project. Better Kitty graphics protocol support.

### TUI-Specific Considerations

**Cell grid quantization**: The layout engine works in pixel coordinates. For TUI, we quantize:
```rust
let col = (glyph.x / cell_width).floor() as usize;
let row = (glyph.y / cell_height).floor() as usize;
```

Wide characters (CJK) occupy 2 cells. The layout engine already knows character widths from cosmic-text; TUI renderer uses `unicode-width` crate to determine cell count.

**Color mapping**: Layout faces use 32-bit sRGB colors. TUI renderer maps to:
- 24-bit truecolor (most modern terminals)
- 256-color palette (fallback)
- 16-color ANSI (minimal fallback)

Detection via `COLORTERM=truecolor` environment variable or terminfo capabilities.

**Inline images**: Modern terminals support image protocols:
- **Kitty graphics protocol** — pixel-perfect, widely supported
- **Sixel** — older but broadly compatible
- **iTerm2 inline images** — macOS terminals

The TUI renderer can optionally support these for `IMAGE_GLYPH` layout items.

**Diffing for performance**: Unlike GPU (clear-and-rebuild each frame), terminals are slow to redraw. The TUI renderer must diff current vs previous grid and only emit changes. This is standard practice (ncurses, crossterm, ratatui all do this).

### Implementation Phase

TUI backend fits as an additional phase after Phase 1 (monospace ASCII):

**Phase 1.5: TUI Renderer**

- Implement `TuiRenderer` that consumes `LayoutOutput`
- Cell grid quantization from pixel coordinates
- ANSI escape sequence output via crossterm
- Grid diffing for incremental updates
- Basic face -> SGR attribute mapping
- Cursor display via terminal cursor

**Scope**: ~1200 Rust. **Difficulty**: Medium.

This phase can proceed in parallel with Phases 2-7 since TUI and GPU renderers consume the same layout output. Each layout feature (faces, display props, bidi) automatically works in both renderers once the layout engine supports it.

### Use Cases

- **SSH sessions** — Full Emacs over SSH without X11 forwarding or GPU
- **Containers / CI** — Emacs in Docker, headless servers
- **Low-resource machines** — No GPU required
- **Terminal multiplexers** — Works inside tmux, screen, zellij
- **Accessibility** — Screen readers work with terminal output
- **Testing** — Deterministic text output for layout regression tests
